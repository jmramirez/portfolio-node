            The idea for this application is to create an e-commerce application,

            Backend
        </h3>
        <p className="project__text">
            The web API is developed using a multiyear architecture, including data access, domain, and HTTP layer.
        </p>
        <p className="project__text">
            <span className="project__text__span">Data access: </span>
            necessary to store information in a database, in this case Entity Framework is used as ORM, 
            and the repository pattern is used as an additional abstraction over the data source. 
            Additionally, a separation between saving operation and reading/writing operations is made using the unit of work approach, 
            so the repository allows higher layers to perform get, create, and update operations on memory collections, 
            while unit of work implements a way to transfer those changes to the database.
        </p>
        <p className="project__text">
            <span className="project__text__span">Data model: </span>
            is the representation of the data handled by the API including entities, 
            data transfer objects (Dtos), as well as all the application logic using the service classNamees approach.
        </p>
        <p className="project__text">
            <span className="project__text__span">HTTP layer: </span>
            includes the action methods that handle all the call requests to the service layer built in the domain project 
            and send the response. 
        </p>
        <h3 className="project__subtitle">Frontend</h3>
        <p className="project__text">
            Frontend consists of a single page application made using react.js, 
            sass for styling, and redux to manage state of the shopping cart as well as authentication token.
